 ac.1.t:0 "Bon Appetite!"
 ac.1.desc:0 "Guards brought poisoned food and vine to your prisoner as you have instructed. Although they seemed surprised to receive such a gracious meal, hunger and thirst did their's job - they ate and drank everything delivered. Won't be long till they drop dead."
 ac.1.a:0 "Goodbye and good riddance!"
 ac.2.t:0 "A Night to Remember"
 ac.2.desc:0 "You slowly entered her cell and sent guards away. She is sitting in front you, eyes closed. She knows this night will be a long one."
 ac.2.a:0 "She is so friendly!"
 ac.3.t:0 "I am a Sculptor of sorts..."
 ac.3.desc:0 "Guards been... "preparing" your prisoner while you've been busy readying all the tools. All sorts of saws, knives and hooks lie before you and that despicable idiot is curled in the far corner of this wet, dark, inhospitable cell. You wonder if this dungeon is soundproof enough for the coming... operation. Yes, indeed, your prisoner will never be the same again..."
 ac.3.a:0 "You know, you can walk... with a limp."
 ac.3.b:0 "Oi! Why the long face? Let me fix it for you!"
 ac.4.t:0 "Just a Prank"
 ac.4.desc:0 "Papers to legitimize arrest are signed and your loyal servants are sent out to bring you your lawful prey. Someone is in for a big surprise!"
 ac.4.a:0 "That reason may not convince everyone... but I AM THE LAW here."
 ac.5.t:0 "An Example for all"
 ac.5.desc:0 "In the beginning crowd was cheering as usually, but the more your prisoner resembled a jumble of flesh, organs and blood, the more quieter it became. When the executioner nailed to the cross the bloody mess which once used to be your loyal vassal, there was dead silence in the air..."
 ac.5.a:0 "Even in death that one spoils my appetite!"
 ac.10.t:0 "Spoils of War"
 ac.10.desc:0 "A number of enemy soldiers was captured after the last battle. It is a good opportunity to send our enemy a clear message. These poor souls can either be ransomed, enslaved, released or slaughtered."
 ac.10.a:0 "Let them go."
 ac.10.b:0 "Make an example of them."
 ac.10.c:0 "Ransom them."
 ac.10.d:0 "Recruit them."
 ac.11.t:0 "Spoils of War"
 ac.11.desc:0 "A number of enemy soldiers was captured after the last battle. It is a good opportunity to send our enemy a clear message. These poor souls can either be ransomed, enslaved, released or slaughtered."
 ac.11.a:0 "Let them go."
 ac.11.b:0 "Make an example of them."
 ac.11.c:0 "Ransom them."
 ac.11.d:0 "Recruit them."
 ac.12.t:0 "Merciless Onslaught"
 ac.12.desc:0 "As the settlement's walls crumble before your might, defenders scatter and hide. Occasional fires can be seen in the distance, but biggest part of the settlement remains intact. It is on your mercy now."
 ac.12.a:0 "This city will be beaten down and sowed with salt!"
 ac.12.b:0 "Loot it! Grab anything what is not nailed down!"
 ac.12.c:0 "Leave it. Whatever we may be, we are not savages."
 ac.13.t:0 "The Ashes"
 ac.13.desc:0 "No mercy! Soldiers moved from building to building, setting afire everything in their path. Anyone not wearing colours of your army was mercilessly slaughtered. In the end former settlement turned into a smoking conflagration without a single living soul among the sooty ruins."
 ac.13.a:0 "It will take years to repopulate this place."
 ac.13.b:0 "They will never forget me. Ever."
 ac.14.t:0 "The Plunder"
 ac.14.desc:0 "Murder, rape and plunder! Religious places were desecrated, homes burnt down, women despoiled and heads of those who tried to resist were put on the pikes! Settlement is no more than ruin now, enlightened by fire and voiced by sorrowful weeping."
 ac.14.a:0 "It is time to move."
 ac.20.t:0 "On the Hunt"
 ac.20.desc:0 "Your most loyal, hand-picked knights stand ready to initiate a realm-wide witch-hunt. No heretic, not a single unwelcomed will be able to escape your wide grasp. Do we go after a specific kind scum or hunt down each and every maggot festering on our great country?"
 ac.20.a:0 "All infidels have overstayed their welcome."
 ac.20.b:0 "Refugees, foreigners, scum of the earth... bah, parasites!"
 ac.20.c:0 "My lands will be cleansed for good!"
 ac.19.t:0 "Dies Irae"
 ac.19.desc:0 "This useless filth rotting away in your dungeons can't be tolerated any longer. The time has come for the final solution - signing death warrants is a waste of good parchment and ink. Mass grave and a noose will do. Actually, why waste the rope when an old rusty dagger will do just fine? "
 ac.19.a:0 "Kill the heretics. God protects."
 ac.19.b:0 "I believe foreigners should be banished. Express-style."
 ac.19.c:0 "Kill them all and rid me of that stench!"
 ac.30.t:0 "Genocide begins"
 ac.30.desc:0 "Most loyal (and bloodthirsty) of our soldiers are ready to march into non-assimilated provinces and unleash merciless slaughter on local population - everyone, who is not of our faith or culture will be put to the sword! They just await final order and payment. But keep in mind, that such... radical methods may require... additional investments."
 ac.30.a:0 "So it begins."
 ac.30.b:0 "On the second thought, I change my mind. This is not our way."
 ac.31.t:0 "Assimilation continues"
 ac.31.desc:0 "Our soldiers are ravaging in the countryside, burning down one village after another, corpses of the locals are already rotting in the fields and Grey Reaper claims more souls every day. Of course, such endeavour couldn't stay in secret - yet untouched settlements start asking questions... how do we proceed?" 
 ac.31.a:0 "There is been... an... outbreak, yeah. Awful plague, loads of corpses. Don't worry, doctors are coming your way as well..."
 ac.31.b:0 "We double our efforts! Quick and quiet!"
 ac.31.c:0 "They can ask whatever they want. Nothing will stop this... pacification"
 ac.32.t:0 "Bets are raising"
 ac.32.desc:0 "Assimilation is proceeding allright! Countryside is now free from undesirable elements though is a bit... empty. Still, it is time now to decide the fate of the big settlements! While we can still slaughter every last children, perhaps we can try a kinder approach?"
 ac.32.a:0 "Temperance is a virtue! Build reservations. Poky ones."
 ac.32.b:0 "Kill. Them. All."
 ac.33.t:0 "Bloody Profit"
 ac.33.desc:0 "Assimilation must be thorough. If we leave any reminders of previous cultures or religions, heretical ideas may plant roots again, bringing old problems back in the process. What should be done with churches, temples, monuments and other cultural legacy?"
 ac.33.a:0 "First loot it, then burn it!"
 ac.33.b:0 "Reconstruct it to serve our own ideas and needs"
 ac.34.t:0 "Assimilation completed!"
 ac.34.desc:0 "Joyous news! The assimilation which we have started so long ago has finally been completed! Provinces are getting repopulated with our settlers, loyal to our Faith, to our Traditions and, most importantly, to You!"
 ac.34.a:0 "Everything is proceeding as I have forseen..."
