Merged Merciless Ruler and Sadism mods for CK3

After Merciless Ruler was removed from workshop I was searching for replacement and found Sadism mod. 
It was close but not what I wanted so I tried to merge them together. 
I have no modding experience with CK so result is far from perfect but it was working on 1.2.x, I haven’t tested it on later versions.
Might look properly in CK modding in the future, but I don’t have any plans right now. Uploaded to git so I don’t lose them and that’s all.
